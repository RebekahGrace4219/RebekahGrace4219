 Hi, I’m @RebekahGrace4219
 
I’m interested in software engineering!  Computer Science is my major and also my passion. 

I’m currently learning upper level circuitry and upper level DSA.  On my owwn, I'm working through *The Clean Coder* by Robert Martin and *Design Patterns: Elemements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides.

I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. When Winter Break rolls around, I'll be working on volunteer projects for "https://www.catchafire.org/", if anyone is interested in doubling up this.

How to reach me:
